/*********************** Exercise 1 ********************* */

// Navigate to your Github profile page
// Identify as many different pieces of functionality that likely use functions.

// List the functions here:

/*********************** Exercise 2 ********************* */
// Fix each function's syntax so that it will correctly run the code in the code block.

// Suggested workflow:

// 1. Uncomment a functionâ€”that is, remove the `//` from the start of each of its lines. (Command-/ will toggle commenting on and off in VS Code!)
// 2. Fix the function so that it no longer gives you an error.
// 3. Repeat.

function sayHello() {
    alert("Hello");
}

 function sayHello () { 
alert("Hello");
 }

function sayHello () {
alert("Hello");
}

/*********************** Exercise 3 ********************* */
// Call the following function so that a random number is alerted in the browser.
// If you don't want to keep getting alerts in this assignment,
// then once you've confirmed it works, feel free to comment the function call.

function alertRandom() {
  let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
  alert(randomNumber);
}

// alertRandom();


/*********************** Exercise 4 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user's for their favorite drink and logs the following phrase to the console. "Your favorite drink is ________."


function myFunciton1() {
let text;
let drink = prompt('What is your favorite drink?');
console.log('Your favorite drink is ' + drink + '.');
}

// myFunciton1();

// Execute the function so that you see "Your favorite drink is [whatever you typed in the prompt]." in the console.
// Feel free to comment out the execution line after you're done, so you don't keep getting prompted.




/*********************** Exercise 5 ********************* */

let user = {
  id: 32,
  fullName: "Trinity Armstead",
  languages: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"],
};

function myFunction2 () {
  let text;
let name = user.fullName.split(' ');
let firstName = name[0];
text = alert('Welcome, ' + firstName + '! You know ' + user.languages.join(', ') + '.');
}

// myFunction2();

// Declare a function that creates an alert that says, "Welcome, Trinity! You know JavaScript, Python, and Ruby."
// Make sure not to use the literal string "Trinity" or the words in the `languages` array.


// Execute the function.



// Below, NOT in a function, change the object's properties in these ways:
// 1. The name should be "Kristal Thomas".
// 2. The second language should be `Racket`.

user.fullName = 'Kristal Thomas';
user.languages[1] = 'Racket'; 

// myFunction2();

// Execute the function again, and you should see a different message printed than the first time, with a different name and a different second language listed.


//Feel free to comment out the function calls once you've confirmed they work.


/*********************** Exercise 6 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for their birth year and prints to the console the sentence, "Your approximate age is [the value in the age variable]."

// Hint: Don't forget that values come in from a user as strings! Subtracting a string from `todaysYear` won't quite work.
// Is there a way to convert it to a number first?

// You can use the following code in your function to calculate the user's approximate age:

let birthYear;
let todaysDate = new Date();
let todaysYear = todaysDate.getFullYear();
let age = todaysYear - Number(birthYear);

function myFunction3 () {
let question = prompt('What is your birth year?');

let age = todaysYear - Number(question);
console.log('Your approximate age is ' + age + '.' );
}

// myFunction3();
// Execute the function. Feel free to comment it out once you've confirmed it works.



/*********************** Exercise 7 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for the following things: age, favoriteColor, favoriteYour.
// Inside the function, create an object to store the user's responses.
// Inside the function, log the following sentence to the console with the user's responses: "Your age is ____, your favorite color is ______, and your favorite movie is ______".

function myFunction4 () {

let age = prompt('What is your age?');
let color = prompt('What is your favorite color?');
let movie = prompt('What is your favorite movie?');

let userResponse = {
userAge: age,
userColor:  color,
userMovie: movie,
}

console.log('Your age is ' + userResponse.userAge + ', your favorite color is ' + userResponse.userColor + ', and your favorite movie is ' + userResponse.userMovie + '.');
}

// myFunction4();
// Execute the function

/*********************** Exercise 8 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for two numbers. Add the two numbers together and log the result to the console.

function myFunction5 () {

  numbers = prompt('Please submit two separate numbers (example: 12 5)').split(' ');
  let numb = numbers.map(Number);

  let total = numb[0] + numb[1];

  console.log('Total value is: ' + total);

}

// myFunction5();
// Execute the function three times.
