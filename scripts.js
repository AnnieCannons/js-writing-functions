/*********************** Exercise 1 ********************* */

// Navigate to your Github profile page
// Identify as many different pieces of functionality that likely use functions.

// List the functions here:
"Clicking on any of the buttons or words like settings, a function has been defined and is being called each click the user makes"

/*********************** Exercise 2 ********************* */
// Fix each function's syntax so that it will correctly run the code in the code block.

// Suggested workflow:

// 1. Uncomment a functionâ€”that is, remove the `//` from the start of each of its lines. (Command-/ will toggle commenting on and off in VS Code!)
// 2. Fix the function so that it no longer gives you an error.
// 3. Repeat.


function sayHello() {
    alert("Hello");
}

function sayHello() {
    alert("Hello");
} 

function sayHello() {
    alert("Hello");
}

/*********************** Exercise 3 ********************* */
// Call the following function so that a random number is alerted in the browser.
// If you don't want to keep getting alerts in this assignment,
// then once you've confirmed it works, feel free to comment the function call.

function alertRandom() {
  let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
  alert(randomNumber);
}
alertRandom();

/*********************** Exercise 4 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user's for their favorite drink and logs the following phrase to the console. "Your favorite drink is ________."

function alertDrink() {
  let favoriteDrink = prompt("What is your favorite drink?");
  return favoriteDrink;
}

console.log("Your favorite drink is " + alertDrink());


// Execute the function so that you see "Your favorite drink is [whatever you typed in the prompt]." in the console.
// Feel free to comment out the execution line after you're done, so you don't keep getting prompted.


/*********************** Exercise 5 ********************* */

let user = {
  id: 32,
  fullName: "Trinity Armstead",
  languages: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"],
};

// Declare a function that creates an alert that says, "Welcome, Trinity! You know JavaScript, Python, and Ruby."
// Make sure not to use the literal string "Trinity" or the words in the `languages` array.

// function welcomeUser(){
//   alert("Welcome " + user.fullName.slice(0,7) + "! You know " + user.languages[0] + ", " + user.languages[1] + ", and " + user.languages[2] + ".");
// }
// // Execute the function.
// console.log(welcomeUser())
function welcomeUser(user) {
  let userName = user.fullName.split(" ")[0];
  let languages = user.languages.join(", ");
  alert("Welcome, " + userName + "! You know " + languages + ".");
}

welcomeUser(user);
console.log(welcomeUser(user));

// Below, NOT in a function, change the object's properties in these ways:
// 1. The name should be "Kristal Thomas".
// 2. The second language should be `Racket`.
user.fullName = "Kristal Thomas";
console.log(user.fullName)

user.languages[1] = "Racket";
console.log(user.languages)

// Execute the function again, and you should see a different message printed than the first time, with a different name and a different second language listed.
//Feel free to comment out the function calls once you've confirmed they work.

//Comments from Laura 
//If a new object was passed into the function, and the user's name was not 7 characters long, what would happen? What can you update in the code to ensure that all names will work

/*********************** Exercise 6 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for their birth year and prints to the console the sentence, "Your approximate age is [the value in the age variable]."

// Hint: Don't forget that values come in from a user as strings! Subtracting a string from `todaysYear` won't quite work.
// Is there a way to convert it to a number first?

// You can use the following code in your function to calculate the user's approximate age:

let birthYear;
let todaysDate = new Date();
let todaysYear = todaysDate.getFullYear();
let age = todaysYear - Number(birthYear);

function userBirthYear() {
  let UBYPrompt = prompt("Please enter your birth year.");

  let age = todaysYear - Number(UBYPrompt);
  console.log("Your approximate age is " + age);
}
// Execute the function. Feel free to comment it out once you've confirmed it works.

userBirthYear()


/*********************** Exercise 7 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for the following things: age, favoriteColor, favoriteYour.
// Inside the function, create an object to store the user's responses.
// Inside the function, log the following sentence to the console with the user's responses: "Your age is ____, your favorite color is ______, and your favorite movie is ______".
function userPrompt() {
  let userAgePrompt = prompt ("What is your age?");
  let userFavColor = prompt ("What is your favorite color?");
  let userFavMovie = prompt ('What is your favorite movie?');

  let userInfo = {
    userAge: userAgePrompt,
    userColor: userFavColor,
    userMovie: userFavMovie,
  }
  
  console.log(`Your age is ${userAgePrompt}, your favorite color is ${userFavColor}, and your favorite movie is ${userFavMovie}.`);
} 
userPrompt();
// Execute the function

/*********************** Exercise 8 ********************* */

// Declare a function that prompts the user for two numbers. Add the two numbers together and log the result to the console.
function userNumbers() {
  let num1 = prompt("Enter a number:");
  let num2 = prompt("Enter a second number:");
  let sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
  console.log("The sum is: " + sum);
}
// Execute the function three times.
